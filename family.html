          <h2>BEST TIME TO VISIT NORTHEAST INDIA </h2>
          <p>If you’re someone who wants to go during the tourist season, then the summer months of April, May and June are the ideal time to visit the northeast. <br>The weather is mostly pleasant, but some lower-lying regions like Arunachal Pradesh can get pretty hot. Barring such regions, you’ll have clear skies,<br> and plenty of outdoor activities to enjoy.</p>
           <p>But if you are ready to get wet in the rain and experience some lush greenery, then plan your trip to the northeast during the monsoon season. From the <br>end of June till September, you’ll find valley upon valley drenched and lush with greenery. The tropical climate indicates heavy rainfall, so this might <br>affect public transport. There may be landslides, so commuting might be a struggle.</p>

          <h2>WHERE TO STAY</h2>
          <p>While there are hotels and resorts in Guwahati that would cater well to finer tastes and travellers who like to vacation in comfort and style, the real <br>fun is in having a more rustic and local experience. Choose from a variety of lodges and homestays all over the different states in Northeast India <br>to get a real taste of this gorgeous region.</p>

          <h2>HOW TO GET THERE:</h2>
          <p><b>By Air:</b> Various major cities in India have direct flights to the states of Assam, Manipur, Tripura and Nagaland. Guwahati is the only metropolitan <br>city that provides access to the other cities in the northeast, for travellers from others of India and the world. Once you’ve landed at Guwahati, you <br>can connect to Silchar, Dimapur, Agartala, Aizawl, Tezpur, Jorhat and Dibrugarh via road. There are some helicopter services available as well.</p>
         <p><b>By Train:</b> There are various train services that run across the country. Which connects to many cities in northeast India. But it’s important to note <br>that they are the slowest mode of transport for reaching any city in the northeast, owing to weather changes that may cause obstructions on the railway network.</p>
        <p><b>By Road:</b> Travelling to the northeast by road is a popular option for the scenic routes that present themselves along the way. There are bus services <br>that run to and from West Bengal to Guwahati. Once you reach Guwahati you can board an ASTC bus from Paltan Bazaar, which connects to other <br>states in Northeast India. Alternatively, you can also travel via private buses, taxis and Volvos that run across the region.</p>
