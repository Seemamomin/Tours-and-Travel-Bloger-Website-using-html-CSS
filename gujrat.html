        <div class="blog1">
            <p>Gujarat offers all that a national or international tourist looks for – a wide range of diverse destinations and attractions. In addition, strong logistic connectivity, excellent communication facilities, adequate health infrastructure, round-the-clock power supply even in the remotest area, safety and<br> security, and above all the hospitable nature of the people make Gujarat a prime destination in India. The varied landscape of Gujarat is a complete <br>package in itself. Here, the White Desert of Kutch coexists with a long and beautiful coastline. The archaeological monuments from different eras go <br>as far back as Harappan time in Dholavira and Lothal. Gujarat has ancient caves, stupas, monasteries, temples, and monuments that exhibit the Indo-Saracenic architectural style which blends elements of Islamic and Hindu architecture.<br>
                <br> People who come to Gujarat get bonded with its charisma because life itself is a celebration here. Welcome to Gujarat, the land of heritage, wildlife, fun, frolic, and food.</p>

            <h2>VADODARA:</h2>
            <p>Vadodara, Gujarat’s third-largest city, is situated on the banks of the river Vishwamitri and is famous as the cultural capital of Gujarat as well as<br> a center of educational activities. Vadodara was originally known as Vadapradaka, which means a village amidst Banyan trees. Archaeological <br>findings show that there was human habitation here from prehistoric times.
                Vadodara passed through the hands of the Imperial Guptas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Solankis, Sultans of Delhi, the Mughals, and finally the Marathas. Present-day Vadodara owes its grandeur to Maharaja Sayajirao <br>Gaekwad III, a great ruler, a socio-economic reformer, a patron of arts, architecture, and music.
